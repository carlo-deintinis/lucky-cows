Final report of the commercial starship Nostromo. Third Officer reporting.
The other members of the crew - Kane, Lambert, Parker, Brett, Ash, and Captain
Dallas - are dead. Cargo and ship destroyed. I should reach the frontier in
about six weeks. With a little luck, the network will pick me up.
This is Ripley, last survivor of the Nostromo, signing off.

I'm ready, man. Check it out! I am the ultimate badass! State of the badass
art! You do not want to fuck with me. Check it out! Hey, Ripley, don't worry.
Me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you! Check it out.
Independently targeting particle-beam phalanx. WHAP! Fry half a city with this

sonic, electronic ball-breakers! We got nukes, we got knives, sharp sticks...
