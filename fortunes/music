I need a SAGA!
What's the SAGA?
It's Songs for the Deaf, you can't even hear it!

A thing of beauty, I know
Will never fade away

A thing of beauty, I know
Will never fade away
What you did to me, I know
Said what you had to say
But a thing of beauty, I know
Will never fade away
And I'll do my duty, I know
Somehow I'll find a way
		-- SAMURAI, "Never Fade Away"

Can you feel it?
Can you touch it?
Get ready 'cause here we go!
		-- SAMURAI, "Never Fade Away"

'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
And I hope this works out
But you know how much you broke me apart
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
I don't wanna know

So, get away
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
And let yourself go
You know you didn't lose your self-control
Let's start at the rainbow
Turn away
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
Let yourself go
Is that a compromise

I swallow all my drugs 'til the pain is unplugged
When the laws of entropy touch, you better dread the judge
Wiser men than us been crushed to fine dust
When the fortune cookie tell me I'm fucked, I just shrug

That's righteous, huh? Cyberpunk holding a pump
Keanu Reeves, cyber arm under my sleeve
I blast 'em all, watch 'em fall like autumn leaves
Damn it, I can't leave, Night City keep calling me
		-- Yankee and the Brave, "No Save Point"
