Hello and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment
center. We hope your brief detention in the relaxation vault has been a
pleasant one. Your specimen has been processed and we are now ready to begin
the test proper. Before we start, however, keep in mind that, although fun and
learning are the primary goals of all enrichment center activities, serious
injuries may occur. For your own safety, and the safety of others, please
refrain from — ***bzzzzt*** Por favor bordón de fallar Muchos gracias de fallar
gracias ***bzzzzt**** Stand back. The portal will open in 3, 2, 1...

Please place the Weighted Storage Cube on the 1500MW Aperture Science Heavy
Duty Super-Colliding Super Button.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Perfect. Please move quickly to the chamberlock, as the effects of prolonged
exposure to the Button are not part of this test.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
You're doing very well. Please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is
not part of any test protocol but is an unintended side effect of the Aperture
Science Material Emancipation Grill, which may, in semi-rare cases, emancipate
dental fillings, crowns, tooth enamel, and teeth.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Very good. You are now in possession of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal
Device. With it, you can create your own portals. These intra-dimensional gates
have proven to be completely safe. The device, however, has not. Do not touch
the operational end of The Device. Do not look directly at the operational end
of The Device. Do not submerge The Device in liquid, even partially. Most
importantly, under no circumstances, should you- ***bzzzt***.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Well done. Remember, the Aperture Science Bring Your Daughter to Work Day is
the perfect time to have her tested.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Once again, excellent work. As part of a required test protocol, we will not monitor the
next test chamber - you will be entirely on your own. Good luck!
[...]
As part of a required test protocol, our previous statement suggesting that we
would not monitor this chamber was an outright fabrication. Good job. As part
of a required test protocol, we will stop enhancing the truth in 3... 2...

		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
You're not a good person. You know that, right?
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
While safety is one of many Enrichment Center Goals, the Aperture Science High
Energy Pellet, seen to the left of the chamber, can and has caused permanent
disabilities, such as vaporization. Please be careful.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Unbelievable! You, [subject name here], must be the pride of [subject hometown
here]!
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Warning devices are required on all mobile equipment. However, alarms and
flashing hazard lights have been found to agitate the high energy pellet, and
have therefore been disabled for your safety.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Please note that we have added a consequence for failure. Any contact with the
chamber floor will result in an "unsatisfactory" mark on your official testing
record, followed by death.  Good luck!
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Very impressive. Please note that any appearance of danger is merely a device
to enhance your testing experience.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
The Enrichment Center regrets to inform you that this next test is impossible.
Make no attempt to solve it.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Fantastic. You remained resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme
pessimism.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
Okay. The test is over now. You win. Go back to the recovery annex. For your
cake. It was a fun test and we're all impressed at how much you won. The test
is over. Come back.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
The Enrichment Center promises to always provide a safe testing environment. In
dangerous testing environments the Enrichment Center promises to always provide
useful advice. For instance, the floor here will kill you - try to avoid it.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"

The device has been modified so that it can now manufacture two linked portals
at once. As part of an optional test protocol, we are pleased to present an
amusing fact: The device is now more valuable than the organs and combined
incomes of everyone in [subject hometown here].

As part of a previously mentioned required test protocol, we can no longer lie
to you. When the testing is over, you will be... Missed.

All subjects intending to handle high-energy gamma leaking portal technology
must be informed that they may be informed of applicable regulatory compliance
issues. No further compliance information is required or will be provided, and
you are an excellent test subject!

The Enrichment Center is committed to the well-being of all participants. Cake,
and grief counseling, will be available at the conclusion of the test. Thank
you for helping us help you help us all.

The Vital Apparatus Vent will deliver a Weighted Companion Cube in 3, 2, 1...
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
This Weighted Companion Cube will accompany you through (most of) the test
chamber. Please take care of it.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
The symptoms most commonly produced by Enrichment Center testing are
superstition, perceiving inanimate objects as alive, and hallucinations. The
Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube will never
threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.  [once second pellet has been
caught] The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube
cannot speak. In the event that the Weighted Companion Cube does speak, the
Enrichment Center urges you to disregard its advice.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%

You did it! The Weighted Companion Cube certainly brought you good luck.
However, it cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately,
must be euthanized. Please escort your Companion Cube to the Aperture Science
Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject
on record. Congratulations.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
The experiment is nearing its conclusion. The Enrichment Center is required to
remind you that you will be baked, and then there will be cake.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Welcome to the final test. When you are done, you will drop the device in the
Equipment Recovery Annex - Enrichment Center regulations require both hands to
be empty before any cake (garbled speech)
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Congratulations. The test is now over. All Aperture technologies remain safely
operational up to 4000 degrees Kelvin.  Rest assured that there is absolutely
no chance of a dangerous equipment malfunction prior to your victory
candescence. Thank you for participating in this Aperture Science
computer-aided enrichment activity. Goodbye.

What are you doing? Stop it! I... I-I... IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII... We are pleased
that you made it through the final challenge where we pretended we were going
to murder you. We are very, very happy for your success. We are throwing a
party in honour of your tremendous success.  Place the device on the ground,
then lie on your stomach with your arms at your sides. A party associate will
arrive shortly to collect you for your party. Make no further attempt to leave
the testing area. Assume the party escort submission position or you will miss
the party.

What are you doing? You haven't escaped, you know. You're not even going the
right way. Hello? Is anyone there?

Uh-oh, somebody cut the cake. I told them to wait for you, but they cut it
anyway. There is still some left, though, if you hurry back.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"

You're not even going the right way. Where do you think you're going? Because I
don't think you're going where you think you're going. Hello?
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Didn't we have some fun, though? Remember when the platform was sliding into
the fire pit and I said “Goodbye”, and you were like,  "No way!" And then I was
all, "We pretended we were going to murder you."? That was great. Is anyone
there?
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
You really shouldn't be here. This isn't safe for you. It's not too late for
you to turn back. I'm not angry. Just go back to the testing area.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
I feel sorry for you, really, because you're not even in the right place. You
should have turned left before. It's funny, actually, when you think about it.
Someday we'll remember this and laugh... and laugh... and laugh. Oh boy. Well,
you may as well come on back.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
You're not a good person. You know that, right? Good people don't end up here.
Can you hear me?
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
This is your fault. It didn't have to be like this. I'm not kidding now. Turn
back or I will kill you. I'm going to kill you, and all the cake is gone. You
don't even care, do you? This is your last chance.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Well you found me. Congratulations. Was it worth it?  Because despite your
violent behaviour, the only thing you've managed to break so far, is my heart.
Maybe you could settle for that and we'll just call it a day. I guess we both
know that isn't going to happen. You chose this path. Now I have a surprise for
you. Deploying surprise in five, four… [morality core drops to the ground] Time
out for a second. That wasn't supposed to happen. Do you see that thing that
fell out of me? What is that? It's not the surprise… I've never seen it before.
Never mind. It's a mystery I'll solve later… By myself… Because you'll be dead.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
[After picking up the morality core]
Where are you taking that thing?  I wouldn't bother with that thing. My guess
is that touching it will just make your life even worse somehow. I don't want
to tell you your business, but if it were me, I'd leave that thing alone. Do
you think I am trying to trick you with reverse psychology? I mean, seriously
now. Okay fine: do touch it. Pick it up and just... stuff it back into me.
Let's be honest: Neither one of us knows what that thing does. Just put it in
the corner, and I'll deal with it later. That thing is probably some kind of
raw sewage container. Go ahead and rub your face all over it. Maybe you should
marry that thing, since you love it so much. Do you want to marry it? Well I
won't let you. How does that feel? Have I lied to you? I mean in this room.
Trust me, leave that thing alone. I am being serious now. That crazy thing is
not part of any test protocol. Just ignore that thing and stand still. Think
about it: If that thing is important, why don't I know about it? Are you even
listening to me? I'll tell you what that thing isn't: It isn't yours. So leave
it alone.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
You are kidding me. Did you just stuff that Aperture Science Thing We Don't
Know What It Does into an Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator?
That has got to be the dumbest thing that... whoa. Whoa, whoa ...
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Good news: I figured out what that thing you just incinerated did. It was a
morality core they installed after I flooded the enrichment center with a
deadly neurotoxin, to make me stop flooding the enrichment center with a deadly
neurotoxin. So get comfortable while I warm up the neurotoxin emitters.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Huh. That core may have had some ancillary responsibilities. I can't shut off
the turret defenses. Oh well. If you want my advice, you should just lie down
in front of a rocket. Trust me, it'll be a lot less painful than the
neurotoxin. All right, keep doing whatever it is you think you're doing.
Killing you and giving you good advice aren't mutually exclusive. The rocket
really is the way to go.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Oh, you think you're doing some damage? 2 + 2 = ***bzzzt***...10. In base four!
I'm fine! I let you survive this long because I was curious about your
behavior. Well, you've managed to destroy that part of me. Unfortunately, as
much as I'd love to now, I can't get the neurotoxin into your head any faster.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
I'd just like to point out that you were given every opportunity to succeed.
There was even going to be a party for you. A big party that all your friends
were invited to. I invited your best friend, the Companion Cube. Of course, he
couldn't come because you murdered him.  All your other friends couldn't come
either because you don't have any other friends, because of how unlikeable you
are. It says so here in your personnel file: unlikeable, liked by no one, a
bitter, unlikeable loner, whose passing shall not be mourned. “Shall not be
mourned”, that's exactly what it says; very formal, very official. It also says
you were adopted, so that's funny too.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
Neurotoxin... So deadly... Ch-choking...
I'm kidding! When I said “deadly neurotoxin”, the “deadly” was in massive
sarcasm quotes. I could take a bath in the stuff, put it on cereal, rub it
right into my eyes. Honestly, it's not deadly at all... to me. You, on the
other hand, are going to find its deadliness a lot less funny.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
That thing you burned up isn't important to me. It's the fluid catalytic
cracking unit. It made shoes for orphans. Nice job breaking it, hero.

This isn't brave. It's murder. What did I ever do to you? The difference
between us is that I can feel pain. You don't even care, do you?

Did you hear me? I said you don't care. Are you listening?

That's it. I'm done reasoning with you. Starting now, there's going to be a lot
less conversation and a lot more killing.

What was that? Did you say something?  I sincerely hope you weren't expecting a
response. Because I'm not talking to you. The talking is over.
		-- GLaDOS, "Portal"
%
This was a triumph.
I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS.
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.
Aperture Science
We do what we must because we can.
For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead.

But there's no sense crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
And the Science gets done and you make a neat gun
For the people who are still alive.

I'm not even angry.
I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart and killed me.
And tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!

Now these points of data make a beautiful line
And we're out of beta we're releasing on time
So I'm GLaD I got burned, think of all the things we learned
With the people who are still alive.

Go ahead and leave me.
I think I prefer to stay inside.
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.
Maybe Black Mesa...
THAT WAS A JOKE. HA HA. FAT CHANCE.
Anyway, this cake is great; it's so delicious and moist.

Look at me still talking when there's Science to do
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you
I've experiments to run, there is research to be done
On the people who are still alive.

And believe me I am still alive.
I'm doing Science and I'm still alive.
I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive.
While you're dying I'll be still alive.
And when you're dead I will be still alive.
STILL ALIVE
STILL ALIVE.
